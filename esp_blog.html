                            A year-long Computer Science module in which
                            students, in
                            groups of 8, were tasked with identifying a problem,
                            interacting with stakeholders, and coming up with a
                            solution
                            across 4 deliverables. The "problem" could be
                            anything, as
                            long as it could be nestled into one of a few (very
                            broad)
                            genres, mind. The module was intended to mimic the
                            development lifecycle of a product in industry,
                            albeit on a
                            significantly smaller scale, but groups were
                            nonetheless
                            encouraged to take the same steps that professional
                            teams
                            would when developing a system - roles,
                            responsibilities,
                            scrum meetings and sprints, the whole package.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Our group of 8 identified several problems but
                            settled on
                            student-society engagement, which here refers to the
                            plethora of ways students interact with their
                            societies, and
                            vice versa, at university. We're talking freshers'
                            events at
                            the very start of the year, sports fairs, special
                            society
                            events, taster sessions, etc.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A very significant amount of time was spent
                            surveying,
                            planning, interviewing, and surveying again to build
                            the
                            base of the project and to guide our trajectory as a
                            group.
                            We used the planning to narrow the scope of the
                            system and
                            drew up a set of objectives approximately halfway
                            through
                            the module's timeline:
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We had many more, all organized according to
                            priority in the
                            final system as it was emphasized by our tutors that
                            the
                            development portion of the project would be a bit of
                            a time
                            crunch, made worse by the fact of the year
                            surrounding by
                            other exams. It was probably that we wouldn't get
                            around to
                            it all, but ultimately that wasn't entirely the
                            point of the
                            module, so that's absolutely fine - it's about
                            developing a
                            plan, and sticking to that plan whilst you battle
                            the little
                            hurdles that pop up along the way.

                            We had outlined the purpose and various functions of
                            the
                            system, and I took responsibility for investigating,
                            testing, and teaching about the technologies we
                            would use
                            for development. While the rest of the team had
                            primarily
                            worked with Python, I had spent time outside of uni
                            exploring other technologies courtesy of curiosity
                            inspired
                            by Stack Overflow's annual surveys. I was already
                            roughly
                            aware of what technologies I thought we'd need
                            during
                            development, so I conducted some preliminary tests
                            and
                            created tutorials to give to the rest of the group.

                        <p>
                            I focused on the notoriously troublesome topics,
                            giving
                            walkthroughs and talks after our weekly scrum
                            meetings on
                            topics like GIT (conventions of branching, merging,
                            frequent
                            commits, and the most common commands), remote
                            version
                            control, as well as our plan for testing and
                            deployment. I
                            provided the group with an overview of our system
                            design,
                            React (and why we should use it), Flask, and Docker.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I spent a great deal of time setting up the initial
                            images
                            and repositories before walking the group through
                            how we
                            would use Docker containers to emulate a more
                            massive system
                            distributed across multiple servers, to insulate the
                            system
                            from our personal machines for standardized testing,
                            as well
                            as to establish remote deployments for testing. We
                            could
                            unify our working environments, distribute tests,
                            and
                            finally deploy the system to Digital Ocean droplets
                            funded
                            by their free credits... The meetings provided an
                            in-person
                            environment for me to help the other developers set
                            everything up on their machines and answer any
                            questions.

                            Development was largely uneventful, thanks to the
                            planning I
                            suppose. Getting over the initial learning curve of
                            React
                            was rough at times, I'll admit, but once I'd gotten
                            comfortable with the idea of hooks, components, file
                            structures, etc., I started to really get into it.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The prevailing group conflict was when a team member
                            repeatedly claimed they had completed their work on
                            the
                            frontend throughout multiple scrum meetings, only to
                            confess
                            to the team — just days before a key deadline — that
                            none of
                            it was actually done. At that point, I was the only
                            one with
                            the React experience needed to get it done in time,
                            so I had
                            to take on the work myself on top of what I was
                            already
                            responsible for. It wasn’t ideal (some late, *late*
                            nights),
                            but given the situation, it was the only way we
                            could meet
                            the deadline. It was definitely frustrating, but we
                            pushed
                            through and got it done in the end. For the next
                            sprint, our
                            time-keepers made sure to have people check in their
                            work
                            frequently to ensure that development was coming
                            along
                            evenly - a practice we should have more strongly
                            encouraged
                            from the start.

                            We had effectively established a small-scale CI/CD
                            pipeline
                            for our society-matchmaker which, granted, might
                            have been
                            overkill for the scope of the project but ended up
                            being
                            very effectively utilized towards the end of our
                            final
                            deliverable once development had mostly finished:

                            We were tasked with writing up a large piece of
                            literature
                            to conclude the module that evaluated our system
                            with
                            respect to where we started. Did it solve the
                            problem we
                            identified, and if so, to what extent? Members of
                            the group
                            conducted interviews with people from the university
                            to
                            compare our system (being ran on the Digital Ocean
                            Droplets)
                            to the existing system (the Student Union website).
                            Unsurprisingly, and much the point of the
                            evaluations, the
                            users sometimes discovered bugs in the system: the
                            team
                            member would contact me, tell me about the bug, and
                            I'd go
                            hunting after lectures to find the issue, test
                            locally, push
                            to the remote branch, wait for the tests to run,
                            before
                            confirming the merge into main. Our GitHub Actions

                            would trigger new images to be built (excluding our
                            tests,
                            additional dependencies, some environmental stuff)
                            before
                            SSH'ing into the Droplets and setting up the new
                            system
                            version, this time without bugs, ready for further
                            evaluation. I'm not entirely sure how we would have
                            done
                            evaluations without remote deployments, and manually
                            patching them every time we found something that
                            needed
                            fixing would have been pretty frustrating.

                            To cut the story short, data was gathered throughout
                            very
                            successful evaluations, and as the native Maths and
                            Computer
                            Science student, I crunched the numbers and did some
                            analysis, wrote up my portion of the deliverable,
                            and got an
                            overall module-grade I'm very happy with.

                    <p>All that said, I'm particularly proud of a few things
                        about this
                        project:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The notion that I was comfortable enough with React
                            half-way
                            through development to be able to take on
                            significant
                            additional responsibilities and a rough deadline,
                            and
                            <strong>still</strong> independantly produce a product that I'm
                            very
                            pleased with.</li>
                        <li>The "My First CI/CD Pipeline" I established for the group during planning and prep. I'd taken a lot of
                            interest in
                            how that sort of stuff had worked before, but
                            getting to
                            grips with Docker hands-on, utilizing remote servers
                            properly, using multiple repositories, and getting
                            everything to work with each other was rough at the start but definitely worth it.
                            I'm much more
                            keen
                            now get a closer look at the DevOps side
                            of
                            industry if the opportunity arrises. The satisfaction of CI/CD working properly was something
                            else...</li>
                        <li>My first serious experience in a role with some
                            decent level
                            of leadership in the context of CS. I was surprised
                            at how
                            much I really enjoyed facilitating discussion,
                            guiding the
                            development portion of the project, and bringing
                            everyone's
                            skills together.</li>
