                        I’m a Computer Science and Mathematics student at the
                        University of Bath with a passion for programming,
                        maths,
                        and problem-solving. I believe that Mathematics and
                        Computer Science are almost inseparable and find their
                        intersection to be more fascinating than either field
                        alone. I’m always eager to learn new skills,
                        technologies, and approaches to tackle real-world
                        problems. Currently, I’m seeking opportunities to gain
                        hands-on experience in software development.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I've taken on some projects—some personal, and some as
                        a part of my course—to explore things that interest me
                        and to learn valuable skills. Please take a look!
                    </p>

                            <p> As part of a year-long Computer Science module,
                                our
                                team tackled the challenge of enhancing
                                student-society engagement at university. This
                                ambitious project simulated a professional
                                development lifecycle, from stakeholder
                                interaction
                                to final delivery.</p>
                            <p> I played a key role in integrating and managing
                                our
                                tech stack, including React, Flask, and Docker,
                                while also guiding the team through the
                                development
                                and deployment phases. </p>

                            <p> I harnessed the power of genetic algorithms to
                                design the ultimate keyboard layout. Using
                                Python, I
                                crafted an algorithm that optimizes keyboard
                                configurations for improved typing speed and
                                comfort. </p>

                            <p> In this personal project, I developed an
                                efficient
                                Sudoku solver that stands out for its speed and
                                simplicity. Inspired by Tom Dillon's Tduko,
                                which
                                uses advanced techniques and bitwise operations
                                in C
                                for optimal performance, I aimed to create a
                                high-speed solver in Python using more
                                straightforward methods.
                                On even the most difficult puzzles, the
                                solver handles puzzles in approx. 0.05 seconds!

                            <p> I approach complexity of the Rubik’s Cube by
                                leveraging H. Kociemba's
                                Two-Phase
                                algorithm to navigate the vast solution space
                                efficiently with my pure-Python implementation.
                                Given the cube’s 43 quintillion
                                possible states, finding the singular solution
                                might
                                seem daunting, but the Two-Phase algorithm
                                uses advanced Group Theory to collapse the
                                complexity and
                                navigate the sea of scrambles. </p>
