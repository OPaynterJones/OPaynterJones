                        <p> The Two-Phase Algorithm works by breaking down the
                            Rubik's Cube solving process into two manageable
                            phases: </p>

                            <li> Phase One: Focuses on the orientations of
                                corners
                                and edges, and the positioning of edges in
                                the

                                Phase Two: Ensures the correct permutation
                                of the
                                cube's pieces while preserving their
                                orientations.
                            </li>

                        <p>
                            I'm going to provide a small, very simplified taster
                            as to what the first phase looks like. The
                            complexity of the problem most certainly lies in the
                            details though...
                        </p>
                        <h2> Phase One: Orientation and UD-Slice Positioning
                        </h2>

                        <p>
                            In Phase One, the goal is to reduce the
                            complexity
                            of
                            the cube's state by only considering three
                            specific
                            aspects:
                            the orientation of the corners, the orientation
                            of
                            the
                            edges, and the positioning of the edges in the
                            UD-slice
                            (the middle layer of the cube). These properties
                            are
                            considered separately to simplify the problem.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Corner Orientation: Each corner can be twisted
                            in
                            one of
                            three ways. The algorithm calculates a
                            coordinate
                            that
                            represents the orientation of all corners except
                            one, as
                            the orientation of the last corner can be
                            inferred
                            from
                            the others. This reduces the search space for
                            corner
                            orientations.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Edge Orientation: Each edge has one of two
                            orientations:
                            flipped or unflipped. Like the corners, a single
                            edge is
                            excluded from the calculations since the sum of
                            edge
                            orientations must always satisfy a specific
                            constraint.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            UD-Slice Positioning: The positions of the edges
                            in
                            the
                            UD-slice are tracked without considering their
                            orientation or permutation. The algorithm
                            assigns a
                            coordinate to this configuration, indicating
                            whether
                            the
                            relevant edges are in the UD-slice or not.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            By only considering these "coordinates"
                            the algorithm can intepret the permutation of
                            the
                            cube in such a way that you can navigate throguh
                            the
                            search space by applying moves to the cube.
                            One searches for a sequence of moves that brings
                            the
                            cube into a state where the corner orientations,
                            edge
                            orientations, and UD-slice edge positions are
                            all in
                            their "solved" configuration (coordinate 0). At
                            this
                            point, the cube is partially solved.

                        <p> You can see here the generation flow of finding a

                        <p> and then the complicated insides of the IDA*
                            search... You can see the lookup tables being used
                            to completely negate actually performing moves on
                            the cube - why calculate the new cube state when you
                            can partially precompute it and just look it up when
                            you need it?
                        </p>
                        <p> You can also see the heuristic being used to provide
                            a lower bound on the number of moves it will take to
                            solve the cube. Precomputing this is where a huge
                            amount of the magic happens, and yet it only
                            features a few lines in the search itself... </p>
