                            problems.</p>

                        <p>Omitting a good deal of techniques that Tom uses to
                            make
                            approach the fastest, the solver uses the <a

                            attempt to find states for all the literals (the

                            a given set of clauses.
                            It should be noted that the
                            "conventional" Sudoku constraints - only one
                            candidate
                            per row|column|box - are not represented explicitly
                            in these clauses,
                            but
                            implicitly through more complex constraints and

                            Tom calls "triads" which, to reduce their simplicity
                            substantially,
                            group up some literals and help to make the

                        <p>
                            All that said, a propositional approach to Sudoku
                            like Tduko's only reduces the amount of "guessing" a
                            solver does; the propositional
                            approach, triads and all, is still slow compared to
                            the other solvers out there, like JCZsolve for
                            example. The key to the speed of Tduko,
                            is in C's
                            bitvectors and
                            the SIMD operations that can process bitvectors
                            unbelievably fast.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Representing all of the above using bitvectors and
                            restricting operations on these bitvectors to
                            exclusively SIMD operations, Tduko has
                            both the reduced search length as a result of the
                            quick and accurate guessing, but also the speed to
                            dominate all the other solvers.

                            Unfortunately... Python does not have the finesse of
                            a langauge like C that would make a chasing a
                            propositional approach like Tom's massively
                            feasable. It could be done, but it'd be messy and
                            likely much slower than a simpler approach.

                            Taking a step back from this therefor, the next best
                            thing would be something a little more simple, like
                            backtracking search or more
                            specifically the Dancing Links algorithm. Whilst DLX
                            is
                            fast, to my knowledge, when pitted against a

                            modified backtracking

                            or use an algorithm like DLX,

                            of a language like C to perform aptly. I tested this
                            solver, and it was able to solve most puzzles in

                            than a second, with some

                            My approach therefor, is a simple algorithm - an
                            implementation of the "solver-basic" solution as
                            proposed by

                            <li>
                                Storing each of the rows, columns, and blocks as
                                a 9 bit
                                integer, where a set bit represents that a

                                yet to be
                                placed in that row|column|box. For example, at

                                significant bit on the far right of the integer,

                                bit means that a 2 has
                                yet to be placed in that row, column, or box.
                                The only

                                complete the search in a timely manner, namely
                                picking
                                the next cell and
                                candidate to
                                propagate with and eliminating the candidate
                                from other
                                cells, can be done using bitwise operations
                                exclusively,
                                which is
                                thankfully something Python can manage fairly
                                quickly.

                                Each iteration of the search, we sort the
                                remaining empty cells by the number of
                                candidates
                                that
                                can be placed in said cells - this is the
                                part of the
                                search which takes place the most, and also
                                takes
                                the
                                longest - thankfully, storing information about
                                the candidates that can be placed in a cell as
                                the aggregation of
                                the possible candidates in their
                                row, column, and box makes this easy. For any
                                given cell we can AND its row, column, and box
                                binary number together count the number of set
                                bits left. That is, the number of candidates
                                that can possibly be placed in that cell.
                                Next, we take the first item in the cell-todo
                                list (with the least amount of possible
                                candidates) before assigning a
                                possible candidate to that
                                cell, "marking" it as done in the todo list, and
                                then
                                calling the search function recursively on this
                                new
                                puzzle state.
                                Note that this means we propagate on any

                                puzzle yourself.
                                Other solvers might look for these cells
                                explicitly,
                                whereas
                                here it's a natural byproduct of the sorting
                                process.
                                If puzzle reaches a
                                point where the first item in that sorted list
                                of
                                cells
                                to fill has 0 candidates, it can be deduced that
                                some
                                assignment up the call
                                stack was wrong - backup and try a different
                                candidate.
                                Otherwise, the search continues until the todo
                                list
                                is
                                completed and a
                                solution has been found.

                        <h2> Implementation </h2>
                        <p>
                            Implementing this approach in Python, I tested a
                            good
                            variety of tweaks, very few of which actually served
                            to
                            improve anything.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For
                            example, the
                            arrays were never big enough to warrant using Numpy
                            arrays with their O(1) lookup times considering the
                            overhead associated with using
                            them;
                            strings were sometimes preferable to
                            lists as
                            their "deepcopy" is apparently <strong>infinitely
                                more
                                efficient </strong> in this context. This means
                            however, that I would
                            be
                            restricted exclusively to string manipulation as an
                            operation, which would inevitably
                            result in more instances of iteration than desired;
                            a
                            significant time boost could be yielded through the
                            use
                            of C coded python extension
                            modules like
                            GMPY, but alas that is outside the
                            scope of this project as such modules are not part
                            of
                            the standard Python library.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I also tried various heuristic modifications: when
                            used in
                            conjunction with the row-column-block data
                            structure,
                            sure, things like searching for
                            hidden-singles or locked-cells is possible, but
                            those
                            tasks are not remotely practical as the data
                            structure
                            just does not lend to
                            the
                            approach
                            whatsoever. The only alteration that could be made
                            to
                            the search heuristic without compromising on its
                            speed,
                            would be to look for full,
                            or
                            almost-full,
                            houses - when a
                            column|row|box only has one or two cells left to
                            place,
                            providing an ample opportunity for speedy
                            propagation.
                            It would only make sense
                            to search for these situations if every cell had ~3
                            candidates at minimum per the preliminary sort
                            (therefor
                            finding a full or almost-full
                            house would provide
                            some actual benefit in propogation), which happens
                            *some* of the
                            time.
                            Having that happen in conjunction with having a
                            row|column|box in the
                            aforementioned state however... Over thousands of
                            the
                            hardest puzzles, just it just doesn't happen.
                            <strong> At
                                all.</strong> This
                            potential modification to the
                            heuristic can be written off.

                        <p>
                            Some changes did make a difference though. For
                            example, simple things like using
                            lookup
                            tables in the form of a dictionary were far superior
                            a
                            Numpy list, regular list,
                            or the builtin method for counting the set bits in a
                            binary integer:

                            If all else fails, try and hash it!
                        </p>
                        <p> <strong> To conclude, it seems to me that what makes
                                fast-solvers fast, is not the search itself or
                                what
                                they use as a heuristic, but
                                the use of
                                datastructure(s)

                                which
                                in turn gives the programmer a little leeway in
                                regard to how they guide the search -

                            Running these puzzles past my solver allowed me to
                            gradually tweak and test the aforementioned
                            adjustments across thousands of
                            test-cases. On average, my solver would solve the
                            puzzles in ~0.04 (+-0.02) seconds, with some taking
                            ~0.5 seconds at worst - I assume
                            these were just puzzles that had suboptimal guessing
                            paths, where the solver might propagate down a path
                            to a great depth, find an issue,
                            backtrack and do it all over again, many, many times
                            until coming to the actual solution. This might be
                            fixed by adjusting the heuristic
                            somewhat, but 0.5 seconds is more than acceptable,
                            so I left it as is. </p>
